Valid Parentheses Problem:

Basically the input is in a variable s and is passed in the class object solution.
Then I have Created a empty stack and a dictionary with the key-value as the opening and closing of same brackets.
A for loop is ran next and it first puts the char in a stack and then it checks whether it is already present or not.
Its a simple code. Then it return the true or false as the output.
Interesting simple code.
